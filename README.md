My eight-year-old son has problems pronouncing certain words. This web-app shows random images within categories of sounds to help practicing the sounds.


A progress bar of overall progress is located above everything.

Per word category count is displayed under the category.

The current word – and an illustration of it – is displayed above the two buttons to read the word via TTS and go to the next word, respectively.
